  Project Description:
  
    Intro:
        This was a Simple approach on Developing a Alaram Clock . I have kept it minimal in the way of Designing , but it has all the functionalities as a typical Alarm Clock
    
    Designing:
        We have used only Vanilla Javascript without any JS Framework
        Flex was been used for the Entire Document styling part
        
    Project Approach :
        1. I had a rough sketch on how my Alarm Clock should look like , then i have started with HTML part following with CSS .
        2.  Once i was satisfied with the Design then i stated working on Javascript part
        3. At first , I thought of Different Functionalities of an Alarm clock .  Then listed out the IMP one and started implementing the it one by one .
